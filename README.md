# Cyber-Capstone-ScadaBR-Home-Automation-System
Cybersecurity Engineering Capstone Project that emulates a small scale smart home system to demonstrate the vulnerabilities of ScadaBR software
This project was not created through GitHub repositories but instead on Google Drive due to our Sponsor's request, so some information will not be available on here/will seem weird to have been developed on here.

For pictures and a handful of other information visit the project's google drive page: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1onq5pMqNgh-Na6b3AuEtWeFiBKDggk9N?usp=sharing
